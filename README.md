This Java app when compiled, allows for user input using the console to construct a Classroom Object with any number of Students and one Teacher.
Then it prints in the console a list of classrooms, each with a variable number of students, depending how many entries there are, the students names will be displayed.

Each classroom also has assigned a class number and a teacher. This information is also printed along the classroom.

To initialize, you need to have Java installed and run it after compiling it using javac and java on the command.
